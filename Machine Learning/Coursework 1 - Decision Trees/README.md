# Coursework 1 : Introduction to Machine Learning - Decision Trees

This project was carried out in a school context by four classmates. 

* Pierre-Antoine ARSAGUET : pea22@ic.ac.uk
* Louis BERTHIER : ldb22@ic.ac.uk
* Nikita DMITRIEFF : nnd19@ic.ac.uk
* Ryan EL KHOURY : re122@ic.ac.uk

Here are the steps to follow to ensure that the environment is up to date and execute our script properly:

1. To move to the folder containing our script:
```python
cd Path_file_to_our_folder_downloaded/main.ipynb
```

2. To use the same versions of the libraries as we do:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. To use Jupyter Notebook (even if we dropped a .py file to ensure the execution of our code in doubt):
```python
pip install notebook
```

4. To run our script, open Jupyter otebook and access our code:
```python
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

Once in the notebook, all you have to do is follow the flow and execute the cells. Normally everything works and nothing needs to be changed.   
However, it is possible to modify some general parameters defined in the 'Execution scripts' blocks in order to modify the training (number of folds, proportion of training and validation, etc...).
